# VBA-challenge

##This is the second assignment for the Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp.

The requirements for this assignment can be found at the following link.

##The Files providing the solution to the VBA-challenge are the following.
1   "WallStMM-mod"    contains the VBA code for the Moderate part of the VBA Challenge in a standard text file.
2   "WallStMM-bonus"  contains the VBA code for the Bonus part of the VBA Challenge  in a standard text file.
3   "WallStMM 2014 screenshot", "WallStMM 2015 screenshot" and "WallStMM 2016 screenshot" show that the VBA code for the Moderate part and
    the Bonus part of the VBA-challenge produce the required results.
    
Github "push" is limited to 50KB in the standard version of Github installed via the Bootcamp installation instructions so we are unable to  
load the "Multiple_year_stock_data" file, the file required for the analysis, which is approximately 96KB.

The VBA code in the standard text files has to be copied to the "Multiple_year_stock_data" file for the purposes of verifying that the solutions work.

The author of the solutions can be contacted at mikemurf@bigpond.net.au.
